Earthquake’s                                                                                                     3                                   strength is determined by measuring two things: magnitude and intensity.  Magnitude                                                            4                                   is the size of an earthquake.  An earthquake’s magnitude is measured using the Richter                                                                                            5                                   scale and is expressed in whole numbers with decimal fractions.  For example, a 5.1                                                                          6                                   magnitude is considered a moderate quake.  The Richter scale does not measure how                                   many damage occurs.  The intensity, on the other hand, is measured using the Modiﬁed                                                      7                                                                                                    9                                   Mercalli Intensity Scale (MI).  This scale consists of 12 levels of intensity.  The MI                                                             8                                                            10                                   scale uses Roman numerals.  A VII earthquake on the MI scale suggests that ordinary                                   buildings have sustained moderate damage while poorly built structures are likely to be                                    severely damaged.  A measure of VIII indicates that chimneys, columns, monuments,                                                    11                                                           12                                   and walls will probably fall.  Using both scales is the best way to determine the severity                                   of an earthquake.                                                                                                                         3                     Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

They can be singular or plural. A count noun is often             preceded by a determiner, which gives additional information to the reader. Determiners include             articles (a, an, the), quantiﬁers (many, a few, several), and other such words or phrases.              (Determiner) + Count           Example             Noun              a / an + singular count noun   An earthquake is one of the most destructive natural disasters.              the + singular count noun      The earthquake in California in 1906 nearly destroyed San                                            Francisco.

Notes             1.  A determiner is a word placed in front of a noun to help identify it. Examples include a, an, the, some, my, your, his,               her, its, our, their.             2.  To make a noun plural, add -s or -es (buildings, earthquakes, winds, beaches). If the noun ends in -y, change the -y to               -i and add -es (injuries, properties).             3.  Some nouns are irregular. To make irregular nouns plural, there are other spelling changes:                t  DIBOHF WPXFM TPVOET PS BEE B EJGGFSFOU FOEJOH  mouse. mice; tooth, teeth; person, people)                t  DIBOHF B mOBM -f to -v and add -es (wolf, wolves; knife, knives)                t  LFFQ UIF TBNF TQFMMJOH BT UIF TJOHVMBS GPSN  deer, sheep)                    1.2   Non-count Nouns              Non-count nouns name things that cannot be counted (e.g., advice, information, homework, research).             They do not have a plural form.

A noun phrase is made up of a core noun and                  other words. Noun phrases often follow one of six patterns.                   Structure                      Example                  1.

Many students who have young children at home prefer online                                                 course options.                   Notes                  1. In academic writing, it is common for a noun to be followed by one or more prepositional phrases.                  2.  In academic writing, noun + noun combinations are common, but their meanings are not always obvious.                    Examples:                    a. a computer analysis = an analysis done with a computer                    b. a computer manual = a manual for a computer                    c. a computer programmer = a programmer of computers                  3.  In any noun + noun combination, note that the last noun is the only noun that can be plural.                    Examples:                    a. two computer problems (not: two computers problems)                    b. ﬁve chemistry lab reports (not: ﬁve chemistry labs reports)                  4.

One reason for this situation                                                                     2                  is the fact that there are not enough doctors to care for all the patients in the hospital.                   3  They are working so many hours and are not giving the best service because they                  are too tired.

The game was in San Francisco.   Sixty-two thousand people were                                                         3             attending the game at Candlestick Park.

NARRATIVE PARAGRAPH                                          A Brief History of Flight                  1  Throughout the course of history, humans have wanted to ﬂy like birds.   In ancient                                                                                  2             times, the Greeks told the story of Daedalus, who made wings for himself and his son              Icarus out of feathers and wax.   In the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci designed a ﬂying                                         3             machine called the Ornithopter.   Although he never actually built his ﬂying machine,                                          4             the modern-day helicopter is very similar to his design.   In the 18th and 19th centuries,                                                               5             people invented hot-air balloons and gliders.   There were also many attempts to build                                                      6             a powered airplane.   It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that these                               7             efforts were successful.   Wilbur and Orville Wright built and ﬂew a motorized airplane                                  8             for the ﬁrst time for 120 feet (37 meters) in 1903.   The airplane has changed our lives                                                         9             dramatically.   Once it took months or even years to cross the ocean, but now travelers                         10             make the trip in hours.   Because of airplanes, we are able to see other countries, eat                                  11             new food, and learn about other cultures ﬁrsthand.                 1. In sentence 1, replace ﬂy with soar above the earth to avoid overuse of words               related to ﬂy.               2. In sentence 2, replace in ancient times with thousands of years ago.               3. It is not good to repeat the same word in adjoining sentences. In sentence 4,               replace ﬂying machine with invention.              4. In sentence 5, replace in the 18th and 19th centuries with over the next few               hundred years.               5. Combine sentences 6 and 7; begin your new sentence with although.               6. Rewrite the clause beginning there was in your new sentence to use the present               perfect.              7. Sentence 8 has a prepositional phrase that indicates time. Move it to the beginning               of the sentence because it is common in academic writing to have a phrase or               clause before the subject of the main clause.              44  UNIT 3  Using the Present Perfect                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

Sit for extended periods of time—in front of                                                                      2                                   a TV, behind a desk, or in a car—increases the risk of obesity, heart disease, high blood                                    pressure, high cholesterol, and even death.   In one study, people who spent more than                                                                         3                                   four hours a day in a chair had a greater chance of dying prematurely than those who                                   spent less than two hours a day sitting down.   To offset these negative effects, doctors                                                                           4                                   recommend less sitting and more moving.   Simple changes could include the following:                                                                         5                                     t   standing up while talking on the phone or watching TV                                       6                                     t   walking with colleagues instead of holding meetings in a conference room                                       7                                     t    installing a stand-up desk or placing one’s computer on top of a counter or                                       8                                        on a stand above a treadmill                                    9   By moving more and sitting less, individuals can gain important beneﬁts such as weight                                     loss, increased energy, and more efﬁciency use of fats and sugars by the body.

Steve Lohr wrote in the New York Times on April 1, 2016.  Steve Lohr                            2             describes an exciting new collaboration among U.S. universities, textile companies, and              the Defense Department to create fabrics that can “see, hear, communicate, store energy,             warm or cool a person, or monitor the wearer’s health.”                                                                            5                 4  High-tech fabrics could have useful applications in many areas.  For example,             sports clothing that could be programmed could sense if a person is having a heart             attack and then call for help.  Soldiers’ uniforms could signal when an enemy is near and                                       6             become invisible.  Mattresses could monitor a person’s sleep and health.                             7                 8  Functional fabrics could help to revive the struggling U.S. textile industry.  It has                                                                                   9             lost jobs as a result of the way the world has become more global.  Lohr writes that                                                                        10                                                                                     11             functional fabrics could “push the American textile industry into the digital age.”   They             could create thousands of new jobs in the process.                  12  The author cautions that many questions remain about the cost, design,                                                 13             marketing, and use of functional fabrics.  Critics worry about privacy and it is possible                                                                14             that the textiles could be hacked, like any digital product.  However, I am convinced             that functional textiles have big potential to help solve real-world problems and to             reinvigorate the U.S. textile industry.                                56  UNIT 4  Using Word Forms                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

Infection is                                                                                                    2                                                       3                                   caused by pathogens.   A pathogen is a substance that your body identiﬁes as harmful.                                                                         5                                   4  It can be a virus, bacteria, or even pollen.   On the outside on the cell of the pathogen                                                                      6                                   are antigens, usually pieces of protein.   Your immune system relies by white blood                                   cells to ﬁght these outside threats.   The white blood cells recognize the antigens as the                                                                  7                                                              8                                   enemy and begin to multiply.

However, within a few days, your body is often able                                   to defend itself.   Some white blood cells (lymphocytes) produce antibodies which                                                  10                                                                                                       12                                   weaken the pathogen.

The object of the preposition is the noun, pronoun, gerund, phrase or clause that follows the preposition.             4. To + noun (to the ofﬁce) is a prepositional phrase, but to + verb (to take) is an inﬁnitive.                        60  UNIT 5   Writing with Prepositions                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

Urban areas have                                                                             2                  increasingly become magnets for afﬂuent and professional young adults.   However,                                                                                   3                  they still face serious problems associated with high density, including crime, trafﬁc,                  pollution, and housing shortages.   How effectively cities deal with these problems                                                4                  may determine how well they continue to be innovative places.   New York City is an                                                                           5                  example of a city that dealt effectively with the crime problem.   New York was perhaps                                                                          6                  the most dangerous city in the United States in the 1970s.   More violent crimes were                                                                      7                  committed on its public transportation than on any other transportation system in                   the world.   But the New York of today is relatively safe.   Something happened.   In                                                                                         10                            8                                                                   9                  1990, the police department changed how it approached ﬁghting crime.

According to their theory, people were more likely to commit serious crimes if                         12                  laws were not enforced.   Their strategy seemed to work. In three years, the number of                                        13                  crimes decreased drastically.                    1.

In sentence 4, replace innovative places with centers of innovation for greater                    emphasis.                   4.

Note             For passive forms, use phrasal modal + to be + past participle.                Your age does not have to be stated on the form.                The statement is supposed to be read by users before they sign it.               76  UNIT 6  Using Modals                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.

ADVANTAGES–DISADVANTAGES ESSAY                                                    Driverless Cars                       1  The development of autonomous driving systems—driverless cars—has advanced                  rapidly since Google introduced the ﬁrst driverless vehicle in 2012.   Several U.S. states                                                                              2                  have passed laws allowing driverless cars.   Some experts predict that driverless cars will                                                        3                  be in wide use all over the world by the year 2020.                      4  Driverless cars would offer some important advantages, according to their                   supporters.   First is the reduced risk of crashes.   The vehicles are operated by computers                                                            6                             5                  instead of error-prone human drivers.   Second is better trafﬁc ﬂow thanks to coordination                                                    7                  between vehicles.   This eliminates the need for trafﬁc signals.   Third, and possibly most                                  8                                                                         9                  signiﬁcant, is the ability of passengers to use travel time in any way they choose.                      10  But new research from the University of Leeds warns that driverless cars will                   change our relationship with our cars and will possibly reduce or eliminate these                  beneﬁts.   Lead author Dr. Zia Wadud explains that driverless cars will cause an actual                          11                  increase in car use because people who want to use their commute time efﬁciently will                   use driverless cars instead of public transportation.   In the worst case, this change will                                                                12                  increase road use by as much as 60 percent.   This is according to the Leeds study.                                                         13                  14  Moreover, possible higher speed limits because of the improved safety of driverless                   cars will reduce energy efﬁciency.                      15  The Leeds researchers conclude that driverless technology will have both pros and                   cons.   In the end, they say, governments will need to determine the best way to manage                       16                  these impacts.

Usually that fear is of something that presents very little or no threat                                                   2                                   to the person.   For example, claustrophobia is the fear of conﬁned spaces, and acrophobia                                                3                                   is the fear of heights.  There are some lesser-known phobias, too.  A person with                                                     4                                                                                            5                                   agyrophobia has a fear of crossing streets, and a person with athazagoraphobia has a fear                                   of be forgotten or ignored.  Although some people advise those with phobias avoiding                                                          6                                   what they are afraid of, this is not always realistic.  For example, a person with autophobia                                                                              7                                   fears being alone and always needs to be around other people.  Fortunately, treatments do                                                                                         8                                   exist.  Treatment can come in the form of medicine, therapy, or a combination of the two.                                       9                                   10  Treatment can help with the symptoms most people with phobias share: a rapid heart                                    rate, chest pain, trouble breathing, sweating, and trembling.

In the past, teenagers were told that not eating chocolate or junk food                         2             would help.  Today, some acne can be treated with topical creams.  The creams unblock                        3                                                                         4             clogged pores.  Sometimes these creams are combined with an antibiotic, such as                           5             doxycycline.  Doctors must be careful.  Antibiotics have side effects.  For example,                                                                          8                                                7                         6             doxycycline causes sensitivity to the sun.

Dermatologists             may ask patients to stop using makeup.  Sometimes when a person stops the use of                                                 12             makeup, the acne goes away on its own and no medical treatment is needed.  Doctors                                                                                  13             are currently conducting a tremendous amount of research on this problem.                 1.

Connect sentences 3 and 4; combine the sentence with the word that and delete               the creams to avoid using the same noun twice.               4.

Then they were shown photos of faces with a variety of                                                                                             5                                   emotions and were asked to imitate the expressions on the faces.  Their brains were                                   scanned to see what areas were active when they felt pain or empathy, or when they                                                       6                                                                                         7                                   were imitating others.  Next, the participants played a game.  In the game they were                                                                                               8                                   given $10 and they had to decide how much to award to a stranger.  Those with the                                   most activity in the areas of the brain associated with empathy and imitating others                                    were given 75 percent of their money to the stranger.                                                                                                                              107                     Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

It is very rare in progressive forms.             3. Sometimes by + the agent (or doer of the action) comes at the end of a passive sentence.

Notes             1.  Passive voice is also a way to avoid using personal pronouns such as I and we as they are often discouraged in               academic writing. Likewise, impersonal pronouns such as someone are vague and can weaken a sentence.             2.  Adverbs can be used to modify a passive verb. In the simple present and past, they appear between be and the past               participle. With perfect tenses or modals, they appear after the modal or form of have and before be.                  Negative campaign ads are often used in presidential elections.                  The ad will not likely be aired again as it was considered offensive and untrue.                   110  UNIT 8  Using the Passive Voice                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

It holds that all persons,                                   regardless of their origins, have the chance to move up in society by working hard and                                   taking risks.

For example, only 22 percent of millennials said that                                                             5                                   helping other people was their most important goal, the lowest percentage in any age                                          6                                   group.  In contrast, 46 percent said that they would not be fulﬁlled unless they had a                                   job that paid a lot of money.   Thirty-two percent said that having luxury items was an                                                            7                                                                             8                                   essential part of the American Dream for them.

These ﬁndings appear to support                                   the stereotype of millennials as self-absorbing and very focused on making money.                                                                                                                          121                     Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

And 22 percent said that they simply did not feel ready to get married.                 10  Another reason for the marriage rate is related to the employment status of                                           11             today’s young men and women.  Most women want to marry a man with a secure job.             12  However, according to the Pew report, millennial men are less likely to be employed             than they were in past decades.  At the same time, more and more women are entering                                          13             the labor force, with the result that there are more single, employed young women than                                        14             single, employed young men.  In the future, women who are having trouble ﬁnding a             suitable marriage partner may elect to marry men who are divorced, widowed, or older.                  1.

Like             adjectives, adjective clauses modify a noun or noun phrase. An adjective clause usually comes after             the noun it modiﬁes and begins with a relative pronoun (that, who, whom, or which). Adjective             clauses are dependent clauses. There are two main patterns of adjective clauses.              Pattern                                          Example              1. Subject adjective clause                                                S     V               relative pronoun + verb                        Transpiration is a process that involves plants.                                                                |     independent clause     |  |     adjective clause     |               The relative pronoun is the subject of the               clause.              2. Object adjective clause                                                 O   S    V               relative pronoun + subject + verb              Transpiration is a process (that) plants use for                                                                |     independent clause     |  |   adjective clause   |               The relative pronoun is the object of the clause.               Object relative pronouns may be omitted.       cooling.              Notes             1. The verb in a subject adjective clause agrees with the noun being modiﬁed.                  Transpiration is a process that involves plants.                  The plants that grow in the desert have to be drought tolerant.             2.  Adjective clauses are dependent clauses. They can come after any noun in a sentence.                  The police are investigating the ﬁre that damaged several buildings last week.             3.  The adjective clause can also come between the subject and the verb of the independent clause. In this case, make               sure the subject and verb of the independent clause agree.                  The ﬁre that damaged several buildings last week was the result of arson.             4.  The relative pronoun takes the place of a subject or object in the clause. Therefore, do not add a subject or               object pronoun to the clause.                  Transpiration is a process that it involves plants.                  Transpiration is a process that plants use it for cooling.                 10.2   Reduced Subject Adjective Clauses              Many subject adjective clauses can be reduced or shortened. There are two patterns:              Pattern                                          Example              1.

The number one                   excuse that these drivers give is that they are late for some extremely important event.                    Most police ofﬁcers are used to hearing this unoriginal excuse, so they do not accept it                    as a valid reason. Drivers who do not pay attention to the speed limit should have to                   pay a high ﬁne for the potentially dangerous situation that they have created. Putting                    innocent people at risk because of an inability to manage time is unacceptable, and it is                   certainly something that the police and transportation laws must be able to discourage.                   136  UNIT 10  Adjective Clauses and Reduced Adjective Clauses                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

She faced many challenges.   She was deaf,                                                                           3             mute, and blind.   Despite her challenges, she learned how to communicate thanks to                            4             a good teacher.   Anne Sullivan was her teacher.   Anne came to the United States from                           5                                                        6             Ireland in the 1840s.   She grew up very poor and actually had her own vision problems.                                7                                                           9             8  She suffered from an eye disease called trachoma.   Trachoma is an eye infection that             can lead to blindness.   It usually occurs when people live in impoverished conditions                                 10             and have limited water and health care.   Sullivan went to a school for the blind and had                                                 11             surgery to correct her limited vision.

It was Helen                    15                                                                            16             Keller who made Sullivan famous.

The ﬁrst two sentences are short and sound very abrupt. Combine these into one               longer sentence using an adjective clause.               2. Sentences 5 and 6 both talk about the teacher. Use an adjective clause to combine               them.              3. In sentence 6, change the verb came to a verb with a more speciﬁc meaning.               4. Both sentences 8 and 9 talk about trachoma, which was her medical condition. Use               an adjective clause to combine them.               5. In sentence 10, does the word it refer to blindness or trachoma? Because the               reference for the pronoun it is not clear, change it to a noun.              6. In sentence 11, the verb went is a weak verb. Change went to another verb with a               more concrete meaning.               7. Both sentences 12 and 13 talk about the director. Use an adjective clause to               combine them.               146  UNIT 10  Adjective Clauses and Reduced Adjective Clauses                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

In                  conversation, we tend to use full clauses. In composition, good writers use a variety of sentence                  structures, including both adverb clauses and reduced adverb clauses. Use subordinating conjunctions                  to accurately express the relationship between the clauses.                 Pattern                                          Example                   1.  Reason or cause: Use because or since        Because Charlie Chaplin’s father left his family,                    before the cause or reason. The effect or result   his mother had to support the family as a singer.                    is in the independent clause.                    2.  Contrast: Use while, although, or whereas    While his mother’s career was not prosperous,                    before a statement that contrasts what is in   Chaplin went on to have a longer and more                    the independent clause.                        prosperous career.                   3.  Concession: Use although, though, or even    Even though Chaplin was difﬁcult to work with,                    though before a statement of concession that   his ﬁlms were very successful.                    may be unexpected or surprising.                   4.  Purpose: Use so that or so to state a purpose,   Chaplin visited the United States one last time                    much like in order to.                         so that he could accept an honorary Academy                                                                   Award.                   5.  Time: Use the following to clarify the time   Chaplin was 77 years old when he produced his                    relationship between clauses: after, as soon   last ﬁlm in 1966.                    as, before, when, while, until, whenever, as,                    once.                   Notes                  1.  Writers may also use because of to state a reason or cause. Note that because of requires a noun after it, and                    creates an adverb phrase rather than a clause.                       The conference was cancelled because the weather was bad.                       The conference was cancelled because of the weather.                  2.  Despite and in spite of are also used to show concession. To create an adverb phrase use despite / in spite of  +                    noun phrase.                       Despite the full moon, it was very dark outside due to the clouds.                       In spite of the full moon, it was very dark outside due to the clouds.                  3.  Reduced adverb clauses tend to sound more formal than clauses that are not reduced, which makes them a better                    ﬁt for academic writing.

Building the White House                       In 1791, George Washington, the ﬁrst president of the United States, chose the site for the White                  House. Construction began in 1792 after Irish-born architect James Hoban won a design competition.                   It took eight years to build the White House. Even though the White House was not completely ﬁnished,                   it served as a residence for John and Abigail Adams. Unfortunately, the British burned it down in 1814.                  Soon after, James Hoban was selected to rebuild the house. It was James Monroe who moved into the                   rebuilt house in 1817. In 1824, while Monroe was living there, he added the South Portico. Andrew                   Jackson oversaw the North Portico addition in 1829. During the 19th century, people proposed making the                  house larger or building a separate residence so that the president had more space to live in. Those plans                   never came to fruition. Since then, the house has been renovated twice. The ﬁrst time was by Theodore                   Roosevelt in 1902. He moved the president’s ofﬁces from the living quarters to what is now known as the                  West Wing. Harry Truman renovated the White House again because it needed structural work. No other                   major work has been done since the Truman family moved back into the house in 1952.                     1.                     2.

DESCRIPTIVE PARAGRAPH                      The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)                 1  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manages the              National Weather Service and plays an important role.   The U.S. government uses the                                                             2             National Weather Service to issue warnings that are related to weather.

It also covers regional areas.                                                                4                                                             6             5  It also manages emergency alerts for severe weather.   Severe weather is storms,             tornadoes, hurricanes, and ﬂoods.   There are other agencies and organizations that                                            7             depend on the National Weather Service.   For example, the aviation industry needs to                                                  8             watch the weather in order to keep passengers on airplanes safe.

In the ﬁrst sentence, add the adverb clause because everyone wants to know what               the weather will be like on any given day to the end of the sentence.               2. In sentence 2, add to decide when after National Weather Service.              3. In sentence 2, change that are related to weather to weather-related and insert it               before warnings so the sentence is more concise and academic.               4. Connect sentences 3 and 4 by using while to form an adverb clause.               5. It is not good to repeat the same word too often. Change also in sentence 5 to               another suitable word and make this the ﬁrst word in the sentence.              6. In sentence 5, add this adverb clause in the best location: whenever it arises.               7. The verb is in sentence 6 is a weak verb. Change is to another verb with a more               concrete meaning.               8. In sentence 7, delete There are and edit so that Other agencies and organizations               is the subject to provide the reader with a concrete subject.

A noun clause can take the place of a noun in a             sentence, so it can be in the subject or object position.

Indirect                  speech (also called reported speech) means the words are reported, generally using a noun clause.                  Reporting verbs such as say, tell, ask, and state are used to introduce direct and indirect speech.                   1. Direct speech                   The Web site says, “The human population more than doubled                    t  6TF RVPUBUJPO NBSLT BSPVOE UIF   during the Industrial Revolution.”                      speaker’s exact words.

The researcher asked herself, “What does this result mean?”                   2. Indirect speech                 The Web site stated that the human population (had) more                    t 6TF TUBUFNFOU XPSE PSEFS       than doubled during the Industrial Revolution.                    t  $IBOHF UFOTFT BOE QSPOPVOT    The reporter asked the candidate if she supported an increase                      when necessary.                in the minimum wage.                                                     The researcher asked herself what that result meant.                   Notes                  1.  When the quote in direct speech comes ﬁrst, use a comma instead of a period inside the quotation marks. Do not                    use a comma if a question mark (?) or exclamation point (!) is used.                       “I have a dream,” Martin Luther King, Jr., said in a famous speech.                       “What does this result mean?” the researcher asked herself.                  2.  For commands, use an inﬁnitive phrase in indirect speech, not a noun clause.                       $PNNBOE  i1MBZ NVMUJQMF TQPSUT JO PSEFS UP BWPJE JOKVSZ w                       *OEJSFDU 4QFFDI  %PDUPST UFMM BUIMFUFT to play multiple sports in order to avoid injury.                      12.3    Changing Direct to Indirect Speech                   Often the verb form changes in the noun clause when using indirect speech.

REACTION–RESPONSE PARAGRAPH                                                Village Dogs                 1  A recent article on village dogs described how these free-ranging dogs were              different from pets, working dogs, and wolves.   I have seen loose dogs on the streets                                                       2             of many cities, and I always thought that they were abandoned.   I learned that most of                                                                      3             these dogs have always lived somewhat independently.   Research has found that they                                                               4             feed and breed on their own.   Research has also found that they take shelter wherever                                        5             they can.   Most of them scavenge for food, often eating garbage.   It takes 100 people                                                                       7                      6             and their garbage to support seven village dogs.   At least that is what recent research                                                        8             suggests.   Dogs do not take care of their puppies.   I was surprised to learn that fact.                      9                                                          10                                                                                12             11  After 10 weeks, the pups have to survive on their own, and many do not.   The             researchers explain that wolves parent in a different way.   The researchers say that                                                                13             wolves protect their young and teach them to hunt.   Biologists have observed that                                                           14             wolves actually regurgitate food to feed their pups.   After reading this article, I think                                                           15             wolves are better parents than village dogs.                 1.

A dependent clause has a                  subject + verb, but it cannot stand alone as a sentence. It depends on—and must be attached to or                  within—an independent clause to clarify its meaning. A complex sentence has one or more of these                  three types of dependent clauses: an adjective clause, an adverb clause, and / or a noun clause.                   1.

Notes                    In academic writing, simple sentences rarely begin with the subject. Instead, one or more prepositional phrases                    appear ﬁrst.

Both pieces are of                  equal weight.

(no subject)             ^              REMEMBER: A complete sentence must have a subject and a verb. If it does not, it is a fragment. A                          sentence must include at least one independent clause. If there is only a subordinating                          conjunction with a dependent clause, it is not a sentence.

In 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered in New York City. Reportedly, none of              the 38 witnesses called the police or tried to help her. Which was very disturbing to             psychologists, among others. Since then, researchers have tried to understand the              “bystander effect.” In other words, the reluctance of onlookers to take action. Several             factors may influence the decision to intervene. First, if there are many people nearby,              and no one is doing anything, a bystander is less likely to take action. The fewer people,              the greater the likelihood of someone intervening. With fewer people, each witness             feels more responsible. Also, people want to behave appropriately and fit in with the              people around them. If no one else is taking action, you might think you are mistaken              about the situation. In addition, the location may affect whether or not people help.             Bystanders are less likely to help in an urban area. More likely to help in areas where              people know their neighbors.                             186  UNIT 13  Writing with Sentence Variety                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

Dystopian literature is a genre in which the author explores social and political                   issues in a dark and negative future. Dystopian fiction has been around for a while,                   at least since George Orwell wrote 1984, it is experiencing a resurgence of popularity,                  especially among young adults. The Hunger Games and the Divergent trilogy are                   examples of novels that have enthralled teenagers as well as adults. Dystopian                   fiction has a number of common elements, there are usually unjust laws and harsh                  punishments. The government often uses propaganda it rewrites history. In this genre,                   human lives are meaningless, mechanized, and restricted. Technology is often misused,                   people are categorized. Why are these themes so popular? Experts think one reason                  may be that young people can see how many similar problems the world faces, let’s                   take climate change as an example. It is entirely possible that we will face the kind of                  devastation depicted in these novels in the near future. Advances in technology may                   be another reason for anxiety, with devices like smartphones and security cameras that                   allow us to be tracked all the time.

People can arrive at solutions to difﬁcult problems through a deliberate, step-by-step analytical                process. Or through insight. With insight, a solution appears suddenly. Recent research suggests                that those sudden solutions are surprisingly accurate.                8. Although one day soon we may have completely driverless cars in the meantime, cars are gradually                taking over some driving functions. For example, some cars slow down automatically to prevent an                accident, and others warn drivers who are getting sleepy.                190  UNIT 13  Writing with Sentence Variety                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

COMPARISON PARAGRAPH                                   Neanderthals versus Modern Humans                  1  Since the mid-nineteenth century, scientists have known about the ancient people             called Neanderthals.   Like modern humans, Neanderthals originated in Africa, but                                2             they made their way to cold and snowy Eurasia much earlier than modern humans.              3  Neanderthals developed differently.   This may have been because of the climate.                                               4                                                                         7                                           6             5  They were shorter and stockier.   They had ﬂaring chests and hips.   They had             prominent brows, wide noses, and sturdy ﬁngers and toes.   However, like modern                                                                  8             humans, it seems Neanderthals lived in families and took care of their sick and elderly.              9  Recent research suggests Neanderthals also divided labor according to gender.                                                      11             10  The women were responsible for clothing.   The men were responsible for tools.                                                                            13             12  Neanderthals shared so many characteristics with modern humans.   Why did they             become extinct?   One possible answer is diet because perhaps 80 percent of the                            14             Neanderthal diet consisted of large animals like mammoths and rhinoceroses.   During                                                                                   15             the Ice Age, they had little access to fat and carbohydrates.   A high protein diet causes                                                                  16             the liver and kidneys to become larger.   This could account for the wide chests and                                                17             hips of the Neanderthals.   When the large animals died out, perhaps the Neanderthals                                    18             died out, too.                  1.

This fact raises an                                                                                             2                                   interesting question: What happens if we invented a process for converting some or all                                   of that garbage into energy?  That is precisely the possibility that a group of American                                                             3                                                                                   4                                   scientists at the Ames Laboratory in Iowa is exploring.   The idea is to use simple yet                                   modern manufacturing techniques to extract clean energy from the garbage at its source,                                                                       5                                   that is, right next to a landﬁll or factory.   As Cynthia Jenks, one of the Ames Laboratory                                   scientists, said, “Where there is waste, there is energy.”   It is estimated that converting                                                                                   6                                                                                                             7                                   garbage into fuel and other useful products could reduce U.S. oil use by 40 percent.   If                                   the process will be successful, it will signiﬁcantly reduce pollution and also provide a                                    boost to the U.S. economy.                                                                                                                          195                     Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

The independent clause expresses the real or possible result of that condition.             The following are patterns of real conditionals.              Conditional Pattern                              Example              1. present real / past real                      If water reaches 32 degrees Fahrenheit               If + S + present, S + present.                 (0 degrees Celsius), it freezes.                 If + S + past, S + past.                       If the suspects passed the lie detector test, the                                                              detectives did not question them further.             2. future real                                   If the polar ice caps melt, animals like polar                If + S + present, S + future.                  bears will have nowhere to live.              Notes             1.   The conditional clause, like all adverb clauses, can come before or after the main clause, but in academic writing,               adverb clauses often begin sentences. When the dependent if-clause or any adverb clause begins a sentence, be               sure to use a comma after it. Do not use a comma if it comes second.                  Water freezes if it reaches 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius).             2.  When or whenever is often used instead of if in real conditionals.                  When the polar ice cap melts, polar bears will have nowhere to live.             3.  Present forms of the verb in either clause can be present simple, present continuous, or present perfect.               Modals may also be used with present meaning.                  If the buzzer has beeped, the device is ready.             4. Modals could / may / might can be used for future as well as standard future forms.                  If the polar ice caps melt, animals like polar bears will have nowhere to live.                  If the polar ice caps melt, animals like polar bears may have nowhere to live.             5. Conditional sentences can also use passive voice.                  If the candidate is elected, more conservative laws will be enacted.                                        196  UNIT 14  Using the Conditional                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning.

The independent clause expresses the imagined result. The following are                  patterns of unreal conditionals.                   Conditional Pattern                              Example                   1. present unreal / future unreal                     t    If + S + past, S + would / could / might + V.

Note                  Remember not to use a comma when the dependent if-clause comes second.                       ACTIVITY 1                  In each clause, label the subject with S and underline the verb. Then write the type of conditional sentence                on the line: Present, Past, or Future Real; Present, Future, or Past Unreal.                  1. If the U.S. president does not like a bill passed by Congress, he or she can veto it.                   2. Many more students would attend college if tuition were free.                   3.  If two parents have blue eyes, it is possible for them to have a brown-eyed child, though this is                     rare.                   4. If the composer Franz Schubert had not died in 1828 at age 31, he might have ﬁnished his eighth                    symphony.                   5.

Newer cars have features to help drivers avoid collisions. For example, if a driver who is                    backing up gets too close to another car or a stationary object such as a tree, a warning                    signal sounds.                   a. expresses the future result of a current situation                   b. describes routine events that tend to occur at the same time                   c. describes a present situation that is imaginary                   3.

My guess is that you have not either.   Most people, if they think about bats at                                                     3                  2             all, imagine blood-sucking vampires that spread disease and get caught in people’s hair.                                                     5             4  This fearful image is almost entirely false.   It may have come from the ﬁctional story of             Dracula.                  6  In reality, bats are gentle creatures that provide critical beneﬁts to humans and             the environment.   Of the world’s 1,000-plus species of bats, only 3 feed on blood.   All                             7                                                                                      8             the remaining species eat insects, fruit, or pollen.   One tiny bat can eat up to 1,000                                                         9             mosquitos in an hour.   Collectively, bats eat billions of tons of insects a year.

Beginning a paragraph with a question is a good way to get readers curious about                    the topic. Change the ﬁrst sentence to a question starting with Have you ever                    considered… Replace the ﬁnal period with a question mark. In sentence 2, delete                    the word either.                   2. Change sentence 5 to an adjective clause, and combine sentences 4 and 5.                   3. At the end of sentence 7, add though not human blood in parentheses. This                    surprising fact will motivate readers to keep reading.                  4. At the end of sentence 9, change the period to an exclamation point for emphasis.                   5. To add variety to your sentence structure, change sentence 11 into a compound                    participial phrase. Attach the phrase at the end of sentence 10. Do not forget to add                    a comma.                   6. It is considered weak style to start a sentence with a conjunction. In sentence 12,                    change And to Moreover, and combine sentences 12 and 13.                   7. Insert for example or a similar phrase in sentence 15, but do not place it at the                    beginning. Add commas as needed.                   8.  Too many simple sentences can make your writing sound choppy. Combine sentences                    16 and 17 into a compound sentence. Delete the repetition of If bats die out.                  9. In sentence 18, change bother to torture to give the sentence more force.                   10. Begin sentence 20 with If and delete so. Exclamation points are rare in academic                    writing. Change to a period.

Use a conditional in your opening sentence.                 Here are some examples of how to begin.                  t   Have you ever considered what our world would be like if we used stopped using                    petroleum?                  t   What would happen if cars were banned in the downtown area?                  t   If I could change one thing about our campus, it would be the parking situation.

Some argue that digital books are the better                                                                    2                                   option.   One reason is that an e-reader is easier to carry and holds hundreds of books.                                         3                                   4  Proponents of digital readers also argue that e-books are cheaper in the long run                                    because there are no printing costs.   Moreover, supporters of print books disagree.                                                                   5                                   6  They claim that digital books are more expensive so that an e-reader is a signiﬁcant                                   investment.   Both sides argue that their choice is better for the environment.                                              7                                   8  Proponents of print books say that digital readers do not help the environment.                                   9  Rather, because technology dates so quickly, old e-readers contribute to the massive                                    amount of e-waste in the world.   On the other hand, opponents of print books claim                                                                10                                   the need for paper for print books will destroy our forests.

Patients should always check to make sure their medical tests are being                      conducted at a reliable laboratory. Accuracy of a test method is monitored by                      the laboratory personnel, whose members should be professionals.

Meanwhile,                      historical patterns cannot always be used to prepare for storms.                     6.  One could argue that store-bought vitamins are nonessential and should not                       be produced. People should get essential vitamins and minerals from food in                      their diets.

A good writer also learns to            create longer, more detailed sentences from simple ideas. Study the short sentences            below.               Jim Thorpe won two medals.               The medals were Olympic medals.               They were gold medals.               He won them in 1912.               He was not allowed to keep the medals.             Notice that every sentence has an important piece of information. A good writer would            not write all these sentences separately. Instead, the most important information from            each sentence can be used to create one longer, coherent sentence.             Read the sentences again; this time, the important information has been circled.                Jim Thorpe won two medals.                The medals were Olympic medals.                They were gold medals.                He won them in 1912.                He was not allowed to keep the medals.             Here are some strategies for taking the circled information and creating a new sentence.             1. Create time phrases to introduce or end a sentence: in 1912             2. Find the key nouns: Jim Thorpe, medals             3. Find key adjectives: two, Olympic, gold             4. Create noun phrases: two + Olympic + gold + medals             5. Connect main ideas with conjunctions: won medals + but + not allowed to keep them             Now read this improved, longer sentence:              In 1912, Jim Thorpe won two Olympic gold medals, but he was not allowed to keep them.             Here are some additional strategies for building better sentences.             1.  Use coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, yet, for, so) to connect related ideas                equally.             2.  Use subordinating conjunctions, such as after, while, since, and because to connect                related ideas when one idea is more important than the other.             3.  Use clauses with relative pronouns, such as who, which, that, and whose to                describe or deﬁne a noun or noun phrase.             4. Use pronouns to refer to previously mentioned information.                224  Appendix 1                    Copyright 2018 Cengage Learning. All Rights Reserved.
